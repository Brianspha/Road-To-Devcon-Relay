# Submission for the Labs Open Finance Bounties

## Project Name
**Micronews**

## Project Summary
Micronews is the first app built on the `Equity Curation Model` (ECM). The ECM is a decentralized revenue and curation model for digital content. The **[ECM proposal paper](https://github.com/michaelcohen716/equity-curation-model)** documents the full architecture of the system. 

*****
*From the paper:*
> The ECM aims to:
> * use equity ownership to incentivize **consistent and reliable participation in content curation**
> * establish a **transparent, dynamic revenue model** to provide predictable income for creators
> * implement a mechanism for indirect governance by **rewarding quality content but avoiding censorship**
