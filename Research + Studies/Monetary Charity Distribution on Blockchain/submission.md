# Submission for the Labs Open Finance Bounties

## Project Name
Monetary Charity Distribution on Blockchain

## Project Summary
Pakistan distributes approximately $10-$20 in unconditional cash grants to 5.9M poor persons/families living in far-flung areas. Binance Charity on the other hand is running a similar operation in Africa. Getting massive amount of cash into massive amount of beneficiaries open doors to corruption. Blockchain and specifically Ethereum is poised to take advantage of the inefficiencies of the existing systems.
